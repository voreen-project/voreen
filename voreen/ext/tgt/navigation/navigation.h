/**
    This is the base class for navigation metaphores.
    Derived classes offer solutions to use typical high-level camera movements in object space
    (e.g. moving camera upon a trackball by mouse, make tracking shot following a spline) in a
    simple way.

    In addition, class it implements basic camera operations like moving or rotating the camera
    in object space. Most deriving classes use these operations to do advanced navigations.
