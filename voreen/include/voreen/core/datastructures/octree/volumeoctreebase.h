 * the actual volume data of the represented volume region. All nodes of a
 * single octree have the same cubic power-of-two dimensions. The brick
 * voxels are stored in a uint16_t buffer in ZYX order, like voxels in a volume.
 * In case of a multi-channel octree, the channel bricks are stored consecutively

 * are discarded.
 *
 * @note In order to reduce the memory footprint of the tree structure,
 *  the nodes do not store data that is constant or can be obtained
 *  during tree traversal, such as the brick dimensions or the
 *  LLF and URB of the represented region. This information
 *  is provided by the octree.

/**
 * Base class for octrees that are used for handling single- or multi-channel volume data, which does not fit
 * into the GPU memory and possibly not even into the main memory.
 *
 * The octree data structure consists of two parts:
 *   - a spatial tree whose nodes represent certain regions of the volume and only store derived information,
 *     such as average and min/max values (@see VolumeOctreeNode)
 *   - a pool of bricks that are associated with the tree nodes and contain the actually volume data
 *     a different resolutions. Each tree node usually references exactly one brick via a virtual memory address,
 *     Homogeneous nodes, however, might not have a brick. All bricks of a single octree have the same cubic dimension.
 *     The brick pool may either be hold in the CPU RAM or managed on the disk (@see OctreeBrickPoolManagerBase).
 *
 * The octree can be used in several ways:
 *   - as a mipmap that allows to extract the entire volume or an axis-aligned slice at a desired resolution.
 *   - by retrieving an octree node that encloses a certain sampling point at a desired resolution.
 *   - by traversing the octree from the root node (mainly for renderers).
 *
 * Internally the octree has cubic power-of-two dimensions, even for NPOT volumes. However, all node access
 * functions expect sampling/voxel positions in normalized coordinates with respect to the dimensions
 * of the represented volume.
